# Getting Started

To develop the booking platform for XYZ, the following functional features can be implemented:

1. Browse movie catalogues by city: The platform will provide a list of movies playing in different cities. Users can select a city to see the list of movies playing in that city.

2. Browse theatres currently running the show: After selecting a movie, the platform will show the list of theatres in the selected city that are currently running the show. Users can select a theatre to see the show timings for the selected movie.

3. Book movie tickets: Users can select a theatre and show timing for the selected movie and choose the seats they want to book. The platform will block the selected seats for a short duration to prevent double-booking. Once the booking is confirmed, the platform will generate a ticket with a unique booking ID.

4. Theatres can create, update and delete shows for the day: Theatres can create, update, and delete shows for the day through a theatre dashboard provided by the platform. The dashboard will provide options to add new shows, update the timing of existing shows, and cancel shows.

5. Seat blocking mechanism: The platform will implement a seat blocking mechanism to prevent double-booking of seats. When a user selects a seat, the platform will check if the seat is available. If the seat is available, it will be blocked for a short duration to allow the user to complete the booking. If another user tries to book the same seat during this period, the platform will display an error message stating that the seat is already booked.
